The following code uses Tailwind's `container` utility class, but the content overflows its container:

```html
<div class="container mx-auto">
  <p>This is some text that is much longer than the container width.</p>
</div>
```

This happens because the `container` class sets the maximum width, but doesn't restrict the content inside from overflowing.
